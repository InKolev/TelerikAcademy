Short introduction to design patterns
-------------------------------------

**What are design patterns?**
	- General, repeatable and reusable solution to a common problem in the software design.
	- Problem-Solution pairs within a given context.
	- Templates for solving certain OOP problems with names to identify them.

“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it in the same way twice.”

**What do patterns deal with?**
Application and system design.
Relationships between classes or other collaborators
Problems that someone already solved
Provides a higher level of abstraction.

**Elements of the design patterns:**
Pattern Name -> Increases vocabulary.
Problem -> Intent, context, when to apply.
Solution -> UML-like structure, abstract pseudo code.
Consequences -> Results and tradeoffs.

**Creational Patterns** 
They deal with initializing and configuring classes and objects. They are composed of two dominant ideas:
Encapsulate the knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.
Hide how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.
