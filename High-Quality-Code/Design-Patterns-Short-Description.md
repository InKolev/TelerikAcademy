Short introduction to design patterns
-------------------------------------

**What are design patterns?**
- General, repeatable and reusable solution to a common problem in the software design.
- Problem-Solution pairs within a given context.
- Templates for solving certain OOP problems with names to identify them.

“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it in the same way twice.”

**What do patterns deal with?**

 1. Application and system design. 
 2. Relationships between classes or other collaborators. 
 3. Problems that someone already solved. 
 4. Provides a higher level of abstraction.

**Elements of the design patterns:**

 1. Pattern Name - Increases vocabulary. 
 2. Problem - Intent, context, when to apply. 
 3. Solution - UML-like structure, abstract pseudo code. 
 4. Consequences - Results and trade-offs.

**Creational Patterns** 
They deal with initializing and configuring classes and objects. They are composed of two dominant ideas:
Encapsulate the knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.
Hide how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.
