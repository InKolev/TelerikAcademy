Introduction to design patterns
-------------------------------------

**What are design patterns?**

 1. General, repeatable and reusable solutions to a common problem in the software design. 
 2. Problem-Solution pairs within a given context. 
 3. Templates for solving certain OOP problems with names to identify them.

*“Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it in the same way twice.”*

**What do patterns deal with?**

 1. Application and system design. 
 2. Relationships between classes or other collaborators. 
 3. Problems that someone already solved. 
 4. Provides a higher level of abstraction.

**Elements of the design patterns:**

 1. Pattern Name - Increases vocabulary. 
 2. Problem - Intent, context, when to apply. 
 3. Solution - UML-like structure, abstract pseudo code. 
 4. Consequences - Results and trade-offs.

Creational Patterns
--------------------

Creational design patterns deal with initializing and configuring classes and objects. 
They are **composed of two dominant ideas**: Encapsulate the knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses. Hide how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.

Structural Patterns 
-------------------

Structural design patterns **describe ways to assemble objects** to implement a new functionality.
They ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
**These design patterns are all about class and object composition**.

Behavioral Patterns
-------------------

Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that **identify common communication patterns** between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
They are **concerned with the assignment of responsibilities** between objects, or, encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it.
